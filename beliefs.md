# Beliefs on how things are and how they should be
* My goals here can best be expressed in the way [Buster originally articulated his](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/edit/master/book-of-beliefs.md):
  * *Get smarter over time by identifying new connections and inconsistencies so I can course-correct when necessary. Keep this public to invite commentary and help keep me accountable.*

### Story arcs I may write:
* Vampires have long been misunderstood. I realize this may upset the cannon but my hypothesis is immortality would tame aggressions and trend towards wisdom, away from greed. What good is amassing resources when they're always available? No one truly savors that which they take by force the longer they have to dwell in it. 
  * All groups have their bad seeds. Our narratives, like our news, highlights the worst, ignores the middle, and barely pays homage to the best of the group
